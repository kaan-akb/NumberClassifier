Introduction

The NumberClassifier class is designed to help you quickly determine the nature of a given number. It employs a basic decision-making process to classify numbers into three categories based on their sign: Positive, Negative, or Zero.

Usage

To use the NumberClassifier class, follow these steps:

Instantiate the NumberClassifier class:
java
Copy code
NumberClassifier classifier = new NumberClassifier();
Call the classify method with a number as an argument:
java
Copy code
int number = 42;
String classification = classifier.classify(number);
The classify method will return a String indicating whether the number is Positive, Negative, or Zero.
Method

classify(int number): String
This method takes an integer number as input and returns a String indicating the classification of the number. The possible return values are:

"Positive" if the number is greater than 0.
"Negative" if the number is less than 0.
"Zero" if the number is equal to 0.
Example

Here's a simple example of using the NumberClassifier class:

java
Copy code
NumberClassifier classifier = new NumberClassifier();
int number = 10;
String result = classifier.classify(number);
System.out.println("The number " + number + " is " + result);
Output:

csharp
Copy code
The number 10 is Positive
